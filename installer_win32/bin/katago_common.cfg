# Config for KataGo C++ engine common

# Example config for C++ (non-python) gtp or analysis engine

# Run the program using: `./katago.exe gtp`
# Run the program using: `./katago.exe analysis`

# In this example config, when a parameter is given as a commented out value,

# Running on an online server or in a real tournament or match
# ===========================================================================
# If you plan to run online or in a tournament, read through the "Rules"
# section below for proper handling of komi, handicaps, end-of-game cleanup,
# and other details.

# ===========================================================================
# Notes about performance and memory usage
# ===========================================================================
# Important: For good performance, you will very likely want to tune the
# "numSearchThreads" parameter in the Search limits section below! Run
# "./katago benchmark" to test KataGo and to suggest a reasonable value
# of this parameter.

# For multi-GPU systems, read "OpenCL GPU settings" or "CUDA GPU settings".
#
# When using OpenCL, verify that KataGo picks the correct device! Some systems
# may have both an Intel CPU OpenCL and GPU OpenCL. If # KataGo picks the wrong
# one, correct this by specifying "openclGpuToUse".
#
# Consider adjusting "maxVisits", "ponderingEnabled", "resignThreshold", and
# other parameters depending on your intended usage.

# Handicap
# ------------------------------

# Makes katago dynamically adjust in handicap or altered-komi games to assume

# Does not affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like
# Lizzie) so analysis remains unbiased. Uncomment and set this to 0 to disable
# this and make KataGo play the same always.
# dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead = 0.045

# Instead of "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead", you can comment
# that out and uncomment and set "playoutDoublingAdvantage" to a value between
# from -3.0 to 3.0 to set KataGo's aggression to a FIXED level. This affects
# analysis tools (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like Lizzie).
# Negative makes KataGo behave as if it is much weaker than the opponent,
# preferring to play defensively. Positive makes KataGo behave as if it is
# much stronger than the opponent, prefering to play aggressively or even
# overplay slightly.
#
# If this and "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead" are both set

# ===========================================================================
# Search limits
# ===========================================================================

# Terminology:
# "Playouts" is the number of new playouts of search performed each turn.
# "Visits" is the same as "Playouts" but also counts search performed on
# previous turns that is still applicable to this turn.
# "Time" is the time in seconds.

# For example, if KataGo searched 200 nodes on the previous turn, and then
# after the opponent's reply, 50 nodes of its search tree was still valid,
# then a visit limit of 200 would allow KataGo to search 150 new nodes
# (for a final tree size of 200 nodes), whereas a playout limit of of 200
# would allow KataGo to search 200 nodes (for a final tree size of 250 nodes).

# Additionally, KataGo may also move before than the limit in order to
# obey time controls (e.g. byo-yomi, etc) if the GTP controller has
# told KataGo that the game has is being played with a given time control.

# Limits for search on the current turn.
# If commented out or unspecified, the default is to have no limit.
maxVisits = 500
# maxPlayouts = 300
# maxTime = 10.0

# Ponder on the opponent's turn?
ponderingEnabled = false

# Limits for search when pondering on the opponent's turn.
# If commented out or unspecified, the default is to have no limit.
# Limiting the maximum time is recommended so that KataGo won't burn CPU/GPU
# forever and/or run out of RAM if left unattended while pondering is enabled.
# maxVisitsPondering = 5000
# maxPlayoutsPondering = 3000
maxTimePondering = 60.0


# ------------------------------
# Other search limits and behavior

# YOU PROBABLY WANT TO TUNE THIS PARAMETER!
# The number of threads to use when searching. On powerful GPUs the optimal
# threads may be much higher than the number of CPU cores you have because
# many threads are needed to feed efficient large batches to the GPU.
#
# Run "./katago benchmark" to tune this parameter and test the effect
# of changes to any of other parameters.
numSearchThreads = 5

# NOTE: 'numSearchThreads' and 'numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread' cannot coexist,
# so set 'numSearchThreads' instead of 'numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread'.
# Try a configuration like this if you only expect the engine to be handling a few queries at a time and you want
# individual queries to return more quickly, and are okay with the results being a bit lower-quality and the overall
# peak throughput on queries to be lower.
#numAnalysisThreads = 2
numAnalysisThreads = 1
#numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread = 16
#numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread = 5

# Try a configuration like this if you expect to be sending large numbers of queries at a time, and want to maximize
# total throughput and also the evaluation quality of all the queries and you never care about the response latency
# of the individual queries, only the throughput as a whole.
# numAnalysisThreads = 32
# numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread = 1

# You will want to increase one or both numbers if you have a powerful GPU, and possibly decrease one or both if you
# have a very weak GPU, and play with the balance between them depending on your use case.
# Read the explanation below to understand how to set these parameters:

# EXPLANATION:
# numAnalysisThreads:                 the number of POSITIONS to be able to search in parallel.
# numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread:  the number of threads to use in the tree search for EACH position.
# (older analysis configs might just have 'numSearchThreads', this is an alias for 'numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread')

# Therefore, the total number of search threads that may be active at a given time could be as large as the product:
# numAnalysisThreads * numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread

# Searching more positions in parallel is more efficient since the different threads aren't conflicting with each
# other on the same MCTS search tree. Using multiple threads on the same search will both make things slower
# and weaken the search (holding playouts fixed) due to out of date statistics on nodes and suboptimal exploration,
# although the cost is minor for only 2,4,8 threads.

# So unlike in GTP, which only ever searches one position at a time and where therefore you might as well make
# numSearchThreads as large as possible, in the analysis engine you often want you often want to keep numSearchThreads small,
# and instead parallelize across positions, so you can reduce conflict between threads and improve the overall throughput
# and strength of the search.

# But obviously you only get the benefit of parallelization across positions when you actually have lots of positions
# that you are querying at once! For example, setting numAnalysisThreads = 8 is useless if you only ever send one or two
# queries at a time!

# Therefore:
# * If you plan to use the analysis engine only for batch processing large numbers of positions,
#   it's preferable to numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread to only a small number (e.g. 1,2,4) and use a higher numAnalysisThreads.
# * But if you sometimes plan to query the analysis engine for single positions, or otherwise in smaller quantities
#   than -num-analysis-threads, or if you plan to be user-interactive such that the response time on some individual
#   analysis requests is important to keep low, then set numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread to a larger number and use
#   a lower numAnalysisThreads. That way, individual searches complete faster due to having more threads on each one.

# For 19x19 boards, weaker GPUs probably want a TOTAL number of threads (numAnalysisThreads * numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread)
# between 4 and 32. Mid-tier GPUs probably between 16 and 64. Strong GPUs probably between 32 and 256.
# But there's no substitute for experimenting and seeing what's best for your hardware and your usage case.

# Keep in mind that the number of threads you want does NOT necessarily have much to do with how many cores you have on your
# system. The optimal may easily exceed the number of cores! GPU batching is (usually) the dominant consideration.

# Play a little faster if the opponent is passing, for human-friendliness.

# where you are testing KataGo with fixed compute per move vs other bots.

# This section configures GPU settings.

# Maximum number of positions to send to a single GPU at once. The default
# value is roughly equal to numSearchThreads, but can be specified manually
# if running out of memory, or using multiple GPUs that expect to share work.

# nnMaxBatchSize is the max number of positions to send to a single GPU at once. Generally, it should be the case that:
# (number of GPUs you will use * nnMaxBatchSize) >= (numSearchThreads * num-analysis-threads)
# That way, when each threads tries to request a GPU eval, your batch size summed across GPUs is large enough to handle them
# all at once. However, it can be sensible to set this a little smaller if you are limited on GPU memory,
# too large a number may fail if the GPU doesn't have enough memory.
nnMaxBatchSize = 64

# Controls the neural network cache size, which is the primary RAM/memory use.
# KataGo will cache up to (2 ** nnCacheSizePowerOfTwo) many neural net
# evaluations in case of transpositions in the tree.
# Increase this to improve performance for searches with tens of thousands
# of visits or more. Decrease this to limit memory usage.
# If you're happy to do some math - each neural net entry takes roughly
# 1.5KB, except when using whole-board ownership/territory
# visualizations, where each entry will take roughly 3KB. The number of
# entries is (2 ** nnCacheSizePowerOfTwo). (E.g. 2 ** 18 = 262144.)
# You can compute roughly how much memory the cache will use based on this.nnCacheSizePowerOfTwo = 23
