This is the commandline version of Leela. You likely will want to use
this together with a GTP-capable GUI, or some other tool that speaks
the GTP protocol.

Leela is compatible with GTP version 2, but note that you must add the
"--gtp" option to enable GTP mode.

Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                 Show commandline options.
  -g [ --gtp ]                  Enable GTP mode.
  -t [ --threads ] arg (=4)     Number of threads to use.
  -p [ --playouts ] arg         Weaken engine by limiting the number of
                                playouts.
  -b [ --lagbuffer ] arg (=100) Safety margin for time usage in centiseconds.
  -l [ --logfile ] arg          File to log input/output to.
  -q [ --quiet ]                Disable all diagnostic output.
  -k [ --komiadjust ]           Adjust komi one point in my disadvantage
                                (territory scoring).
  --noponder                    Disable thinking on opponent's time.
  --nonets                      Disable use of neural networks.
  --nobook                      Disable use of the fuseki library.
  --gpu arg                     ID of the OpenCL device(s) to use (disables
                                autodetection).

Note that although the engine can be handicapped by limiting the playout
count, playouts are not standardized so this is not a suitable setting
for comparisons between engines. The OpenCL version is stronger at a
given playout count.

Ruleset
-------
Leela plays according to Chinese rules: area scoring with positional superko.

Linux
-----
To get the OpenCL version working, you will have to to install
both the OpenCL libraries for your GPU (e.g. nvidia-libopencl1) as
well as an OpenCL ICD loader (e.g. ocl-icd-libopencl1 or nvidia-opencl-icd
or mesa-opencl-icd - the ICD loader is not card specific and they are
supposed to be interchangeable).

You can see the installed OpenCL drivers in /etc/OpenCL/vendors/

Benchmarking
------------
Leela contains a number of internal benchmarks that can be used
to judge the speed (and resulting strength) of a system:

- CPU, integer operations: type "benchmark".

Reference score, Intel Core i5-6600 on Windows = ~12800 g/s (3200 g/s per thread)

- CPU and GPU, floating point: type "netbench". The OpenCL version
will run this computation on the GPU, but CPU speed and core count still
matters for keeping the GPU fed.

Reference score, Intel Core i5-6600 on Windows = ~100 p/s (first/predictions)
Reference score, Intel Core i5-6600 on Windows = ~265 p/s (second/evaluations)

Reference score, NVIDIA GTX 1070 on Windows =    ~475 p/s (first/predictions)
Reference score, NVIDIA GTX 1070 on Windows =   ~1850 p/s (second/evaluations)
